https://github.com/albertoRamon/Kylin/tree/master/KylinWithMain


Apache Kylin is a powerful software which enables Extrem OLAP cubes on Hadoop system, with lineal scalability and sub-second response time over TB of data
I studied the integration level ok Kylin with some BI Tools (Qlik, HUE, Tableau, Sisense, Caravel, ...)

Thanks, Alberto
